## Part 1

I was studying to be a sound technician, meanwhile I was developing videogames on [Arma 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/107410/Arma_3/) engine, using his propietary language [SQF](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/SQF_Syntax).

I developed:

- [PoP Life](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pop+life+gameplay) ([source](https://github.com/Icaruk/Poplife2)): It's a life simulator and roleplaying game mode. Players can choose to play as civilians, police or medics. The police enforce the laws and protect the innocent civilians from dangerous criminals. Civilians can earn a living through picking food, mining minerals, delivering packages, trafficking drugs and more.

- [Desolation by Icaruk & nerkaid](https://www.mediavida.com/foro/gamedev/desolationmod-arma-3-555897): It's a survival PvPvE MMORPG. The world is devastated and up to 100 players will try to survive in [Lemnos](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Lemnos,+Grecia/@39.903945,25.1470602,11.75z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14af9308e2419f95:0xd91859654cb35ebd) 270 km² greek island dominated by two factions. The players must join a faction and fight their enemies, [complete quests](https://i.gyazo.com/aab3c3cb16191f42433aa5bb611066e6.gif), [upgrade their equipment](https://i.imgur.com/wD5xNPM.png), level up, [learn new skills](https://i.imgur.com/4ZfA6yJ.png) and conquest zones.

- [p0](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arma+3+p0+life): It's a life simulator and roleplaying game mode. With all the base features from PoP Life, p0 has a player driven economy. Up to 150 players can build enterprises and hire other players to work for them. All the food, vehicles and tools are crafted by these enterprises prior recolecting materials, processing them, crafting products and selling them on player shops. This is like PoP Life but more complex and more economy oriented.

I spent more than **7500 hours** on these projects.



## Part 2

Working as sound engineer on [FLUGE](https://www.fluge.es) (Viñarock festival and others), various orchestras, my home studio, [Marina d'Or](https://www.magicworldresort.com) and other audiovisual event enterprises, was too time consuming, so I had no time or energy left to code.



## Part 3

I decide to do a bootcamp to learn the most used technologies in the market in order to get my first IT job.  
**I get my first job 2 weeks before the end date of the bootcamp.**
