# 👋 Hi!  
I'm Adrián "Icaruk" and I love building stuff. I always have a side project to work on, the purpose of which is to learn new things, to have fun or build something useful for me.
My strengths are:

- 🔮 Creativity
- 🧹 Clean and scalable code
- 📄 Documentation
- 🏆 Teamwork

You can see some of my code in my [Github](https://github.com/icaruk).  
You can contact me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-tortajada/).
